            <h3>Engineering</h3>
            <p>Engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design, develop, and improve structures, systems,<br>
                 and technologies. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines such as Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, and Computer Science Engineering.<br>
                  Engineers play a vital role in solving real-world problems and driving innovation across industries.<br>
                 The field is essential for infrastructure development, technological advancement, and improving quality of life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Degree</h3>
                
            <p>A Bachelor's degree in Engineering (B.E. or B.Tech) is a four-year undergraduate program that provides<br>
                 foundational knowledge and practical skills in a specific engineering field. Students study core subjects, undertake lab work, and engage in projects<br>
                  to understand how theoretical concepts apply to real-world scenarios. The degree equips graduates with the technical expertise needed for entry-level jobs in engineering and technology sectors. <br>
                It also lays the groundwork for higher studies and professional certifications</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Post graduation</h3>
            <p>Post-graduation in engineering, such as M.E., M.Tech, or M.S., is a two-year advanced program pursued after completing a bachelor's degree.<br>
                 It allows students to specialize in a specific area like Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, VLSI, or Structural Engineering. This level of study involves in-depth coursework, research,<br>
                  and often a thesis or project. A postgraduate<br>
                 degree enhances career prospects by qualifying individuals for higher-level roles in research, academia, and specialized industry positions.</p>
