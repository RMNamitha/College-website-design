This repository contains a fully responsive and modern college website design built using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript. The website includes essential sections such as a landing page with an "Explore Now" call-to-action, an About Us section, Courses Offered, Campus Facilities, a virtual campus tour, and a contact form with Google Maps integration. It is designed to provide a clean and engaging user experience for prospective students and visitors. The layout adapts smoothly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This project showcases practical front-end development skills and can be used as a template for educational institutions or for learning web design fundamentals.
